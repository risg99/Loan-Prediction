# Loan-Prediction : Using Basic ML Algorithms

Classification is a skill every Data Scientist aspirant should be well versed in. In this project, we have solved a real life case study of Dream Housing Finance. The company deals in all home loans. They have a presence across all urban, semi-urban and rural areas. Customers first apply for a home loan after that company validates the customer's eligibility. The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form.


The objectives of this project are:
* Apply concepts of Exploratory Data Analysis and Pre-processing to filter
the dataset
* Solve binary classification problem with basic ML algorithms
* Predicted loan value for a specified input


# Files In The Project:

* train.csv - training data
* test.csv - testing data
* train.py - python file to train the data
* univariate.py - python file to visually analyse the data wrt a single variable
* bivariate.py - python file to visually analyse the data wrt two or more variables
* sample_submission.csv - results of the test.csv are stored in here, along with the ouput variable for the entries
